===========

This is a library that allows users to directly control a WaterColorBot
(see http://watercolorbot.com/) by writing Python code. It also makes
use of the ``turtle`` library in order to allow the user to visualize
what their program's output will look like without having to actually
have the WaterColorBot paint it. Hopefully this saves you some paint.
